Using data from the Health and Retirement Study matched to Medicare and Medicaid claims, we identify a retrospective cohort of adults with a claims-based ADRD diagnosis along with matched controls. We find the costs attributable to ADRD are $15,632 for traditional Medicare and $8833 for Medicaid per dementia case over the first 5 years after diagnosis. Seventy percent of Medicare costs occur in the first 2 years; Medicaid costs are concentrated among the longer-lived beneficiaries who are more likely to need long-term care and become Medicaid eligible.
